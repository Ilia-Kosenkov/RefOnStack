# Allocating* reference types on stack**
- <sup>*</sup> actually, copying
- <sup>**</sup> anywhere where one can get a sufficiently large `Span<byte>`
  
This small demo is inspired by ridiculously cool series of blog posts by  Adam Furmanek (see his first part [here](https://blog.adamfurmanek.pl/2016/04/23/custom-memory-allocation-in-c-part-1/), or watch his amazing [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0DeuoIbyrs)).

## Ok, but why?
Well, because. Because it is interesting to see what programming language allows to do. It is unlikely that this approach (in its current form) has any real-life applications, apart from, *probably*, storing multiple instances of some class tightly packed in an array (rather than storing references like it happens for all reference types).

## Example one
Take an object, copy its data to some buffer, then obtain a valid reference (of type `T`), which points to the data in the buffer.
Modify objects and demonstrate they are two different things. Use `GC.GetGeneration(object)` to determine `GC` generation, which acts as a proxy to the type of memory where the object is allocated. Generation is (likely) determined by inspecting `Gen0` and `Gen1`. If object is not found there, it should be in `Gen2`... or, in our case, in some weird block of unmanaged heap or stack memory.

NOTE: In this example, GC Gen 0 is a signature of heap object, while GC Gen 2 is a signature of non-heap object

## Example two
Store multiple objects side by side in an array.
With the ability to write any object to an arbitrary block of `Span<byte>` memory, it is easy to emplace multiple objects next to each other (knowing the actual size of underlying data).
The challenge is to retrieve those objects.
Two methods are provided: `RefReadObj<T>(Span<byte>, ref T?)` and `T CopyObj<T>(Span<byte>)`.
The first one assigns to `ref T` value, which data pointer points to `Span<byte>`, directly,
In principle, if the layout of class is known (which is difficult to predict), one can write to `Span<byte>` and observe changes in returned `ref T`.
The second one returns a shallow copy of the object stored in `Span<byte>`. This newly-constructed object is a regular object residing in managed heap, yet all its fields have their values set from the data stored in the memory chunk.
Speaking in terms of structs, `RefReadObj<T>` acts as ref indexer (`ref T[]` when `T` is a struct), while `T CopyObj<T>` acts as just indexer (`T[]` when `T` is a struct, performing copy).
